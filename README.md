# BradberryPi
This will likely be a collection of scripts that I use with my Raspberry Pi and NodeMCU ESP8266 chips. Topics include email notifications/alerts, houseplant soil sensor data storage and display (typically soil hygrometers and temperature), and more. Updates coming very soon. If a public frontend is ever hosted, I will provide a link here.
